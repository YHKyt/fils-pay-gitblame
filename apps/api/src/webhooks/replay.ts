 * The single definition of "what does replaying one delivery mean", used by

 * batch-replay function — so the two can never mean different things.
 *
 * Re-signs with a fresh timestamp (the dispatcher signs at send time) but
 * keeps the original delivery_event_id: the Webhook-Delivery-Id is stable
 * across retries and replays, and receivers dedupe on it, so a receiver that
 * already processed the original treats the replay as a duplicate. The
 * stored envelope's own `id` is set to the same value, so a receiver deduping
 * from either the header or the parsed body gets a consistent answer.
 *
 * The original row (payload + signature) is never mutated — forensic value
 * is preserved there, not by resending its exact bytes.
 *
 * Takes a PoolClient so the caller controls the transaction: the batch path
 * needs every insert and its audit row to commit or roll back together.
